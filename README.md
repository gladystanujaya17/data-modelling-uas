# Code Documentation Data Modelling Final Exam
## Background
Wine is one of the alcoholic drinks is the result of fermentation of already ripe fruit crushed or from grapes. 
Alcohol content in wine is around 12-15%. 
Although using grapes, types of the grapes used are of the Vitis vinifera species, different from the grapes that are usually eaten every day. 
Wine is known to have high antioxidants so it can provide health benefits.
In this research, the data tested is the result of analysis grapes grown in the Italian region, but originating from three different cultivars. 
There are 178 data samples in the dataset with 13 parameters in the table and all data is of numeric type.
The aim for this analysis is to find a model that can predict wine with 13 pre-measured parameters.
In addition, this analysis aims to determine main differences of the three classes in the dataset.

## Algorithm Used in Code Documentation
1. K-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN)
K-Nearest Neighbor is a one of Machine Learning algorithm.
Although K-NN is one of the simplest learning, but this algorithm has an important role in carrying out deep classification.
This K-NN algorithm falls into the category Supervised Learning.
K-NN algorithm works based on with the proximity of data to other data and closeness of the distance is measured based on the Euclidean distance.

3. Random Forest Classifier
Random Forest Tree is one of machine learning algorithm that goes into the classification and regression.
Random Forest Tree is an algorithm which is formed from the Decision Tree algorithm.
This algorithm widely used in various cases such as banking or e-commerce to predict actions and results end, failure of parts in production, loan repayment failure, etc.
This research will use Random Forest Classifier for classifies the wine data.
